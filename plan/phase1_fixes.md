# RSS Feed Issues Resolution Report

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ All Issues Resolved

## Issues Identified

### Issue #1: newsBTC Content Extraction Failure
- **Symptom**: Only extracting 91 characters of content
- **Impact**: Medium - feed working but content incomplete
- **Priority**: High

### Issue #2: cryptopotato Feed Failure  
- **Symptom**: Zero articles returned
- **Impact**: High - complete feed failure
- **Priority**: High

## Diagnostic Process

### Tool Created: `news/diagnose_feeds.py`
A specialized diagnostic script to investigate feed issues:
- Direct feed access testing
- HTML structure inspection
- Class selector validation
- Alternative selector discovery

### Findings

#### newsBTC Investigation
```
Current selector: 'content-inner jeg_link_underline' → NOT FOUND
Alternative selectors tested:
  ✅ 'entry-content': 3,615 chars (BEST)
  ✅ 'jeg_content': 9,195 chars (too verbose)
  ✅ 'jeg_inner_content': 8,285 chars
```

**Root Cause**: Website HTML structure changed during redesign

#### cryptopotato Investigation
```
Feed URL: https://cryptopotato.com/feed
Response: HTTP 403 Forbidden
Entries: 0
Bozo (error): True
```

**Root Cause**: Site actively blocks automated RSS access

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Fix #1: newsBTC Class Selector Update

**File**: `news/rss_parser.py`

**Change**:
```python
# BEFORE
"newsBTC": {
    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/feed",
    "class": "content-inner jeg_link_underline",  # ❌ Outdated
}

# AFTER
"newsBTC": {
    "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/feed",
    "class": "entry-content",  # ✅ Updated
}
```

**Result**: 
- Content extraction: 91 chars → 3,436 chars (37x improvement)
- Status: ❌ FAIL → ✅ PASS

### ✅ Fix #2: cryptopotato Feed Removal

**File**: `news/rss_parser.py`

**Change**: Removed cryptopotato from feed configuration

**Justification**:
1. HTTP 403 error indicates intentional blocking
2. No technical workaround without violating site policy
3. 6 remaining feeds provide comprehensive crypto news coverage
4. Documented in code for future reference

**Result**:
- Feed removed from production
- Documented in code comments
- Can be reconsidered if site policy changes

```bash
python -m news.test_rss_feeds

3. **Alternative Sources**: Can add new feeds if coverage gaps identified
4. **Diagnostic Tool**: Keep `diagnose_feeds.py` for future troubleshooting

## Conclusion
